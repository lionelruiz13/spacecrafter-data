Hi guys,

This project is frozen and is no longer maintained on this account.  Spacecrafter is not dead: Lionel RUIZ's fork is active. Just follow the fork link.

Kind regards

Association Sirius

1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spacecrafter is free open source (GPL) astronomy and Earth science simulation
and visualization software which renders realistic views around our solar 
system in real time with openGL. It is available for Linux/Unix.

Spacecrafter was branched from Nightshade 11.12.1 in January, 2012.  Our focus is 
on planetarium and simulator use and to provide updates in the future.
Desktop use and Spherical mirror is no more supported.

Nightshade was branched from Stellarium 0.8.2 in August, 2006.  Their focus was 
on planetarium and simulator use, although desktop use is also supported.
                    http://www.nightshadesoftware.org

Note that the '`' (back tick) key is the equivalent of the shift button on a 
Digitarium (R) planetarium system remote control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see the INSTALL file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. REQUIREMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux environment (preferably Ubuntu)
A 3d openGL acceleration vide card (WITH CURRENT DRIVERS!) and a good CPU.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. QUICK START
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigation :
Use the direction keys or drag with the mouse to move the point of view.
Use page up and page down keys or mouse wheel to zoom in and out.
Use left mouse button to select an object, right button to select no object.

Zooming on nebulas or planets is very interesting....
Use J, K and L to increment/decrement time speed.
See documentation on the website for other functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most useful configuration options can be set from within the program.

You can however change it by hand in the file $HOME/.spacecrafter/config.ini on
a Linux system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Runtime diagnostic information is output to the console while spacecrafter is
running. The information can be useful to debug certain Stratoscript calls.
On Windows platforms this information is output to two files, stdout.txt and 
stderr.txt in Spacecrafter's root directory. Windows7 and Vista users must run
Spacecrafter as administrator to enable this diagnostic output. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
